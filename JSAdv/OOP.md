4 Pillars of OOP

4 Pillars = Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism



##Encapsulation

Procedural programs have data scatterred all over the place, keeping data together and updated is challening. OOP was invented to solve this problem. OOP gathers related objects together

Encapsulation - this means all the data about an object is stored in a single class

Abstraction - we don't care about contents, just the outcome, so long as everything stays inside the object

Inheritance - This simplifies declaring objects and reduces redundant code

Polymorphism - In every class, the same program can react in different ways
